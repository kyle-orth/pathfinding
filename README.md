# pathfinding
Create maps and experiment with several different pathfinding algorithms, including experimental AI, in an interactive workspace.

---Feature Overview---
*Note that some features may be unavaliable during development
1) The Editor
   In the Editor tab, draw, save, or load maps of various sizes in the program.
2) Algorithm Showcase
   In the Algorithm Showcase tab, experiment with different pathfinding algorithms such as breadth-first, and A* pathfinding.
   Visualized the different processes, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each when used in different maps.
3) AI Showcase
   Visualize how paths can be taught to nueral networks through reinforcement learning. Train the AI program to tackle different maps of various complexities.
